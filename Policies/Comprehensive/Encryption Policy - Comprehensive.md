# Encryption Policy - Comprehensive

## Purpose
To provide standards and guidance for encrypting data in transit, at rest, and in use, aligned with **NIST SP 800-175B**, **ISO 27001 A.10**, and **CIS Control 3**.

## Scope
All organizational data and systems where sensitive information is processed, stored, or transmitted.

## Policy Statement
Sensitive and regulated data must be encrypted using approved algorithms and key management procedures to protect confidentiality and integrity.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team:** Implement encryption technologies, manage keys, and monitor compliance.  
- **Managers:** Approve encryption for non-standard systems.  
- **Users:** Handle encrypted data per policy.  
- **Compliance Team:** Ensure encryption meets regulatory and contractual requirements.

## Policy Requirements
- Approved encryption standards: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.  
- Key management must include separation of duties, rotation, and secure storage.  
- Use full-disk encryption for endpoints and removable media.  
- Encrypt sensitive data before sharing with third parties.  
- Annual review of encryption technologies and policies.

## Enforcement
Failure to comply may result in regulatory penalties, operational risk, and disciplinary measures.

## Exceptions
Documented, risk-assessed, and approved by IT Security and Compliance.

## Review and Revision
Reviewed annually or when cryptographic standards evolve.
