# Access Control Policy - Comprehensive

## Purpose
To define comprehensive access control standards that protect organizational systems and sensitive data in accordance with **NIST SP 800-53**, **ISO 27001 Annex A.9**, and **CIS Control 4**.

## Scope
All users, contractors, vendors, and third parties accessing organizational systems, applications, or data.

## Policy Statement
Access to systems and data will be governed by **least privilege**, **segregation of duties**, and **role-based access control (RBAC)**. Access is granted only when necessary and regularly reviewed.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team:** Implement, monitor, and audit access controls; manage privileged accounts.  
- **System Owners:** Approve access requests, review accounts quarterly, and ensure compliance with segregation of duties.  
- **Managers:** Validate access requests for staff.  
- **Users:** Protect credentials, report anomalies, and comply with access procedures.  
- **Compliance Team:** Monitor access control compliance for regulatory requirements.

## Policy Requirements
1. **User Account Management**  
   - Unique accounts required; service accounts documented.  
   - Temporary accounts must expire automatically.  
   - Privileged accounts require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and separate audit logging.  

2. **Authentication**  
   - Password complexity, rotation, and MFA enforced per NIST SP 800-63 guidelines.  
   - Biometrics or hardware tokens required for high-risk access.

3. **Authorization**  
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with documented role definitions.  
   - Separation of duties enforced to reduce conflict of interest.

4. **Remote Access**  
   - VPN with MFA required.  
   - Access logs reviewed weekly; anomalies escalated.

5. **Periodic Review**  
   - Quarterly review of all privileged accounts.  
   - Annual review of all user accounts and access rights.

6. **Audit and Reporting**  
   - Maintain audit logs per regulatory requirements (e.g., SOX, HIPAA, GDPR).  
   - Log retention minimum: 1 year (or longer if required).

## Enforcement
Violations may result in disciplinary action, including termination, civil penalties, or legal action.

## Exceptions
Must be documented, risk-assessed, and approved by the CISO with compensating controls.

## Review and Revision
Reviewed annually, after major organizational changes, or following security incidents.
