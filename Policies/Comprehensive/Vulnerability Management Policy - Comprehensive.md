# Vulnerability Management Policy - Comprehensive

## Purpose
To systematically identify, evaluate, and remediate vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks, aligned with **CIS Control 7**, **NIST SP 800-40**, and **ISO 27001 A.12.6**.

## Scope
All organizational systems, software, and network devices.

## Policy Statement
Vulnerabilities must be detected through automated and manual methods and remediated according to severity and risk impact.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team:** Conduct scans, manage vulnerability tracking, and report status.  
- **System Owners:** Apply patches and mitigations within defined timeframes.  
- **Managers:** Monitor compliance and ensure timely remediation.  
- **Compliance Team:** Validate program effectiveness.

## Policy Requirements
- Perform automated scans monthly; high-risk systems scanned weekly.  
- Manual penetration testing at least annually for critical systems.  
- Critical vulnerabilities: remediation within 15 days.  
- Medium vulnerabilities: remediation within 30 days.  
- Low vulnerabilities: remediation or mitigation documented within 60 days.  
- Maintain a vulnerability register with ownership, status, and risk rating.  
- Exceptions require documented compensating controls.

## Enforcement
Non-compliance may result in operational risk, regulatory penalties, or disciplinary action.

## Exceptions
Documented, risk-assessed, and approved by IT Security.

## Review and Revision
